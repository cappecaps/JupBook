Welcome to this thing. I’m not sure what this is, but I created it with the intent of collecting all my “side projects” and publishing them in a single place. Driven by pure curiosity, I love to create mathematical models to describe phenomena, explore ideas, or solve doubts that pop up in my head. Nothing of what I’ve done is new, quite the opposite: I am obsessed with not looking anywhere for hints or solutions, except when strictly necessary, or I’m stuck for days on a single thing. And hence the name of the blog: from the italian version of “rediscovering the wheel”, that is “discovering hot water” (“hai scoperto l’acqua calda!”). It won’t be surprising that most of the things you will read here are likely well-known and derived with a bad inefficience. Many interpretations will be at the very least inaccurate. But this blog is not meant to be an enciclopedia, but rather a collection of my thoughts, ideas, and obsessions.\n\nI’ll be more than happy to receive any feedback, suggestions, or corrections!Prepare to discover hot water with me!\n\nMarco","type":"content","url":"/intro","position":1},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":""},"type":"lvl1","url":"/dca","position":0},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":""},"content":"","type":"content","url":"/dca","position":1},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":""},"type":"lvl1","url":"/continuous-return","position":0},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":""},"content":"","type":"content","url":"/continuous-return","position":1},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":""},"type":"lvl1","url":"/equally-vs-mc-weighted","position":0},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":""},"content":"","type":"content","url":"/equally-vs-mc-weighted","position":1},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":""},"type":"lvl1","url":"/index-funds","position":0},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":""},"content":"Idea: see how the rise of index funds affects the market","type":"content","url":"/index-funds","position":1},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Personal finance"},"type":"lvl1","url":"/intro-finance","position":0},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Personal finance"},"content":"Idea: create an index of risk based on max drawdown vs boh\n Triggered by ep 200 of The Bull.

This approximation works well with the Earth’s atmosphere, because it has a sufficiently low density and high temperature. From the ideal gas law, the pressure is given by:p=nk_BT\n\nwhere n the numerical density of the gas, and T its temperature. To model Earth’s atmosphere, we imagine an infinitely high column of gas subjected to Earth’s gravitational field. For now, we assume that Earth is spherically symmetric. The pressure of the gas at certain altitude h must be equivalent to the pressure exerted by the column of gas above it, due to the gravitational field, i.e.:nk_BT(h) = p(h)=\\dfrac{F(h)}{A}\n\nwith F the weigth of the gas column above h, which is given by the integral along the vertical direction z of the mass density \\rho(z) of the gas, times the gravity g(z):p(h) = \\int_h^{+\\infty}g(z)\\rho(z) dz  = \\int_h^{+\\infty}g(z)m_0(z)n(z) dz\n\nwhere we expressed the mass density ρ as the product between the average mass of the gas particle, m_0, and the numerical density, n. We can rearrange and convert the equation in its differential form, knowing that n(+\\infty)=0:\\dfrac{d}{dh}p(h)=-g(h)\\,m_0(h)n(h) = -g(h)\\,m_0(h)\\dfrac{p(h)}{k_BT(h)}\n\nWhere we used equation \n\n(1) to express the numerical density in terms of density and temperature. It is important to note that equation \n\n(4) only depends on variables at the altitude h and its proximity (the derivative), and not on the whole gas column that sits above. This mathematical step permits us to reach for a solution, but at the cost of not being able to find the absolute value of the pressure.  Rearranging equation \n\n(4) we have:\\dfrac{\\dfrac{d}{dh}p(h)}{p(h)}=-\\dfrac{1}{k_B}\\dfrac{g(h)m_0(h)}{T(h)}\n\nBy integrating in dz from 0 to h we eventually obtain the general solution of how the pressure varies with the altitude:p(h)=p(0)\\exp\\bigg[-\\dfrac{1}{k_B}\\int_0^h\\dfrac{g(z)m_0(z)}{T(z)}dz\\bigg]\n\nWhere p(0), the pressure at h=0, is not known, and must be obtained from the observed data. If we choose h=0 to be the sea level, then p(0) is the barometric pressure, which in standard conditions is 1013.25\\ \\mathrm{hPa}. We will understand how temperature and average mass vary with altitude in the following section. For now, let’s find the simplest solution by assuming that are all variables inside the integral, i.e. composition, temperature, and gravity, are constants. Such approximation is valid close to the Earth’s surface level. We then obtain:p(h)=p(0)\\exp\\bigg[-\\dfrac{m_0gh}{k_BT}\\bigg]\n\nWe recognize m_0gh as the potential energy of a single gas particle, and k_BT its thermal energy. Wait, what? Equation \n\n(7) is called barometric formula. The exponential term is the Boltzmann factor (e^{-E/k_BT}), which, in a canonical ensemble (NVT, our case), represents the probability of system to be in a state with energy E. In our case, E is the potential energy of a mass in an uniform gravitational field, and the Boltzmann factor represents the probability of a particle to be at that altitude. Macroscopically, this becomes the actual pressure of the gas.","type":"content","url":"/pressure#the-barometric-formula","position":5},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Atmospheric pressure and altitude","lvl2":"Adding lapse rate"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/pressure#adding-lapse-rate","position":6},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Atmospheric pressure and altitude","lvl2":"Adding lapse rate"},"content":"International Standard Atmosphere\n\nThe International Standard Atmosphere (ISA) is a model that describes how the atmospheric parameters change with altitude.

The geopotential altitude arises when assuming a constant gravitational field with g_0=9.80665\\ \\mathrm{m/s^2}, the standard gravity at MSL, and it is related to potential energy, E=mg_0h. Specifically, a geopotential difference of 1\\ \\mathrm{m} corresponds to a potential energy difference of 9.80665\\ \\mathrm{J}. For example, on the North Pole, where g_{np}>g_0, a geometric height of 1\\ \\mathrm{m} corresponds to a geopotential altitude that is larger than one meter:mg_0h_{geop} = mg_{np}h_{geom} \\implies h_{geop} = \\dfrac{g_{np}}{g_{0}}h_{geom} > h_{geom}\n\nMore rigorously, denoting Earth’s radius with R, the geopotential height h is related to the geometric height z according to the formula:h = \\dfrac{R}{R+z}\\,z\n\nThe geopotential altitude is the one that we used in the section \n\nThe barometric formula, where we assumed g constant.

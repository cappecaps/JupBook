Welcome to this thing. I’m not sure what this is, but I created it with the intent to collect all my “side projects”, publish them in a single place, and making them available in the internet.\n\nDriven by a implacable curiosity, I am obsessed with creating mathematical models to describe the world around me, explore ideas, or solve doubts that pop up in my head. The model must be rigorously ab initio, namely from first principles. My end goal is, whether possible, to obtain analytical solutions. Modelling is a challenge that necessitates perseverance, but at the same time it stimulates deep thinking and sharpen your problem solving skills. Carefully choosing the approximations is in itself a real form of art: it requires creativity and imagination, as well as the skill to visualize your system and what you want to narrate through the model.\n\nNothing of what I’ve done is new, quite the opposite: I am obsessed with withdrawing in my shell and not looking anywhere for hints or solutions, except when strictly necessary. It won’t be surprising that most of the things you will read here are surely already well-known, and many interpretations inaccurate at best. This blog is not meant to be an enciclopedia, rather a collection of my thoughts, ideas, and obsessions. If I ever catch the interest of even one person in the world, I’ll be more than happy.\n\nPlease feel free to contact me for any feedback, suggestions, or corrections!\n\nMarco## Content of SideHub","type":"content","url":"/intro","position":1},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":""},"type":"lvl1","url":"/dca","position":0},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":""},"content":"","type":"content","url":"/dca","position":1},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":""},"type":"lvl1","url":"/continuous-return","position":0},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":""},"content":"","type":"content","url":"/continuous-return","position":1},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":""},"type":"lvl1","url":"/equally-vs-mc-weighted","position":0},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":""},"content":"","type":"content","url":"/equally-vs-mc-weighted","position":1},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":""},"type":"lvl1","url":"/index-funds","position":0},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":""},"content":"Idea: see how the rise of index funds affects the market","type":"content","url":"/index-funds","position":1},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Finance Modelling"},"type":"lvl1","url":"/intro-finance","position":0},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Finance Modelling"},"content":"Idea: create an index of risk based on max drawdown vs boh\n Triggered by ep 200 of The Bull.

For some reason, I’ve always been obsessed with air pressure, perhaps because I discovered that it can be measured outstandingly precisely with a smartphone. It can even detect altitude changes on the order of meters. So I asked myself: can I derive how the atmospheric pressure varies with altitude, and can I do it as accurately as possible? This way, I could estimate a change in altitude by measuring the change in pressure with my phone. And it works rather nicely!","type":"content","url":"/pressure-theoretical-model","position":1},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"The atmospheric pressure","lvl2":"Introduction"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/pressure-theoretical-model#introduction","position":2},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"The atmospheric pressure","lvl2":"Introduction"},"content":"In this chapter, we will try to find, in an ab initio manner, how atmospheric pressure and altitude are related to each other.","type":"content","url":"/pressure-theoretical-model#introduction","position":3},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"The atmospheric pressure","lvl2":"Theoretical model"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/pressure-theoretical-model#theoretical-model","position":4},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"The atmospheric pressure","lvl2":"Theoretical model"},"content":"","type":"content","url":"/pressure-theoretical-model#theoretical-model","position":5},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"The atmospheric pressure","lvl3":"The barometric formula","lvl2":"Theoretical model"},"type":"lvl3","url":"/pressure-theoretical-model#heading-barometric-formula","position":6},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"The atmospheric pressure","lvl3":"The barometric formula","lvl2":"Theoretical model"},"content":"We start from considering an ideal gas. This approximation works well with the Earth’s atmosphere, because it has a sufficiently low density and high temperature. From the ideal gas law, the pressure is given by:p=nk_BT\n\nwhere n the numerical density of the gas, and T its temperature. To model Earth’s atmosphere, we imagine an infinitely high column of gas subjected to Earth’s gravitational field. For now, we assume that Earth is spherically symmetric. We also assume that the mass of the atmosphere is negligible, so that there is no self-interaction, which would make the problem not analytically solvable. The pressure of the gas at a certain altitude h must be equivalent to the pressure exerted by the column of gas above it, due to the gravitational field, i.e.:nk_BT(h) = p(h)=\\dfrac{F(h)}{A}\n\nwith F the weight of the gas column above h. The pressure of the column can also be calculated as the integral along the vertical direction z of the mass density \\rho(z) of the gas, times the gravitational acceleration g(z):p(h) = \\int_h^{+\\infty}g(z)\\rho(z) dz  = \\int_h^{+\\infty}g(z)m_0(z)n(z) dz\n\nwhere we expressed the mass density ρ as the product of the average mass of the gas particle, m_0, and the numerical density, n. We can rearrange and convert the equation in its differential form, knowing that n(+\\infty)=0:\\dfrac{d}{dh}p(h)=-g(h)\\,m_0(h)n(h) = -g(h)\\,m_0(h)\\dfrac{p(h)}{k_BT(h)}\n\nWhere we used equation \n\n(1) to express the numerical density in terms of density and temperature. Note that equation \n\n(4) only depends on the altitude h and its proximity (the derivative), and not on the whole gas column that sits above. This mathematical step permits us to reach for a solution, but at the cost of not being able to find the absolute value of the pressure. Rearranging equation \n\n(4), we have:\\dfrac{\\dfrac{d}{dh}p(h)}{p(h)}=-\\dfrac{1}{k_B}\\dfrac{g(h)m_0(h)}{T(h)}\n\nBy integrating in dz from 0 to h we eventually obtain the general solution of how the pressure varies with the altitude:p(h)=p(0)\\exp\\bigg[-\\dfrac{1}{k_B}\\int_0^h\\dfrac{g(z)m_0(z)}{T(z)}dz\\bigg]\n\nInterestingly, to compute the pressure at a certain altitude h we just need to know how the integrand varies below that point, and not above. This is because the formula assumes we know p(0), the pressure at h=0, so that the information of the air column above is implicitly contained there. If we choose h=0 to be the sea level, then p(0) is the barometric pressure, which in standard conditions is 1013.25\\ \\mathrm{hPa}. In reality, the sea-level pressure varies continuously and it must be measured. We will understand how temperature and average mass vary with altitude in the following section. For now, let’s find the simplest solution by assuming that are all variables inside the integral, i.e. composition, temperature, and gravity, are constants. Such approximation is valid close to the Earth’s surface level. We then obtain:p(h)=p(0)\\exp\\bigg[-\\dfrac{m_0gh}{k_BT}\\bigg]\n\nWe recognize m_0gh as the potential energy of a single gas particle, and k_BT as its thermal energy. Wait, what? Equation \n\n(7) is called the barometric formula. The exponential term is the Boltzmann factor (e^{-E/k_BT}), which, in a canonical ensemble (NVT, our case), represents the probability of the system to be in a state with energy E. In our case, E is the potential energy of a mass in a uniform gravitational field, and the Boltzmann factor represents the probability of a particle to be at that altitude. Macroscopically, this becomes the actual pressure of the gas.","type":"content","url":"/pressure-theoretical-model#heading-barometric-formula","position":7},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"The atmospheric pressure","lvl3":"Empirical interlude: Earth’s atmosphere","lvl2":"Theoretical model"},"type":"lvl3","url":"/pressure-theoretical-model#empirical-interlude-earths-atmosphere","position":8},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"The atmospheric pressure","lvl3":"Empirical interlude: Earth’s atmosphere","lvl2":"Theoretical model"},"content":"Reference atmospheric models\n\nThe International Standard Atmosphere (ISA) is a model that describes how the atmospheric parameters change with altitude.

However, the molar fractions they provide sum to more than one, due to experimental error (as also \n\nwikipedia reports). While looking for the most precise values, I noticed an incongruence in the reported amount of \\mathrm{CO_2}. I quickly realized a shocking fact: the atmospheric concentration of \\mathrm{CO_2} is rising so quickly that most values are now outdated.

The most impactful one is arguably dry air: on Earth, air is never completely dry, but some water vapor is mixed with the other gases. In practice, addition of water vapor affects the composition, namely the molar mass m in our model.Furthermore, water droplets and ice crystals can also be encountered, which are clouds.","type":"content","url":"/pressure-theoretical-model#lapse-rates","position":17},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"The atmospheric pressure","lvl3":"Humidity","lvl2":"Theoretical model"},"type":"lvl3","url":"/pressure-theoretical-model#humidity","position":18},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"The atmospheric pressure","lvl3":"Humidity","lvl2":"Theoretical model"},"content":"The amount of water vapor in the air is usually measured in relative humidity (RH or ϕ), which is the fraction of the water vapor in the air relative to the “maximum” potential at that temperature.\n\nRelative humidity and water vapor pressure\n\nRelative humidity ϕ is defined as the ratio between the measured partial pressure of water p_w and its equilibrium (saturation) vapor pressure p_{vap,w}:\\varphi = \\dfrac{p_w}{p_{vap,w}}\n\nNote that these terms assume a different meaning in physics and in meteorology. In physics, the vapor pressure of a substance is the partial pressure of the gas phase in equilibrium with the liquid phase. In meteorology, however, vapor pressure refers to the measured partial pressure of water vapor, even when not in equilibrium, whereas the saturation vapor pressure is the actual vapor pressure of water, i.e., in equilibrium conditions. This nomenclature comes from the erroneous idea of air dissolving water vapor, eventually reaching a saturation limit. In reality, the vapor pressure of a substance only depends on the liquid-phase temperature, in first approximation. Here, we will try to use the correct physical definitions, albeit minding such incongruences.\n\nThe dependence of the vapor pressure of a substance on temperature can be estimated from the Clausius-Clapeyron equation knowing its boiling point T_b at standard pressure p^\\circ  (p^\\circ = 1 atm = 101325 Pa, and T_b = 99.97°C for water)p_{vap}(T) = p^\\circ \\cdot \\exp\\bigg[{-\\dfrac{\\Delta_{vap} H}{R}\\bigg(\\dfrac{1}{T}-\\dfrac{1}{T_b}\\bigg)}\\bigg]\n\nWith \\Delta_{vap} H the enthalpy of vaporization. However, this formula lacks of the desired accuracy, because of the numerous approximations that led to it: ideal gas, constant \\Delta_{vap} H with temperature, no volume change, etc. This is particularly true for water, which deviates from the ideality due to the strong intermolecular interactions it can establish. For this reason, it is common to use empirical formula. Here, we are going to use the \n\nArden Buck equation (where T is in °C, and it returns Pa)p_{vap,w}(T) = 611.21\\cdot \\exp\\bigg[{\\bigg(18.678-\\dfrac{T}{234.5}\\bigg)\\bigg(\\dfrac{T}{257.14+T}\\bigg)}\\bigg]\n\nIn order to account for humidity in our model, we need to calculate f_{H_2O}, the molar fraction of water in the air, from the relative humidity. Given equation \n\n(19):f_{H_2O}(T) = \\dfrac{p_w}{p} = \\dfrac{\\varphi \\cdot p_{vap,w}(T)}{p}\n\nwith p the atmospheric pressure. The average mass of a mole of humid air m_{m} (subscript “m” from moist) now includes the molar mass of water m_w:m_m(T) = m_d\\left( 1 - f_w(T) \\right) + m_w f_w(T)\n\nin which we added the subscript “d” for m as in equation \n\n(17), to make clear that it refers to dry air. Humidity reduces the average molar mass of a parcel of air, so that it makes the pressure smaller.\n\nBefore introducing humidity in our model, we need to make a step further. Notice from \n\n(22) that the molar fraction of water, needed to compute the average molar mass of moist air, depends on the atmospheric pressure itself. This causes a problem, since the pressure is our sought variable. We can get around this through a trick, where we use a “first-order” pressure profile p_1(h) given by equation \n\n(17). Since water vapor stays within the troposphere, including just the first lapse rate \\Gamma_1 = 6.5 °C/km is sufficient. Since we usually know the temperature at altitude h, and not at MSL, we write:T(z) = T(h) - \\Gamma_1 \\cdot(z-h)\n\nAnd substitute it in \n\n(17):p_1(h)=p(0)\\exp\\bigg[-\\dfrac{gm_d}{R}\\int_0^h\\dfrac{1}{T(h)-\\Gamma_1(z-h)}dz\\bigg]\n\nwhich can now be solved analytically:p_1(h)=p(0)\\exp\\bigg[-\\dfrac{gm_d}{R\\Gamma_i}\\dfrac{T(h)+\\Gamma_1 h}{T(h)-\\Gamma_1(z-h)}dz\\bigg]f_{H_2O}(h,T) = \\dfrac{\\varphi \\cdot p_{vap,w}(T)}{p_1(h)}\n\nSea-level pressure reduction\n\nAtmospheric pressure is always reported at the MSL. When a weather station at a certain altitude measures the local pressure, that value is then reduced to the sea level. In other words, the station must estimate the pressure that would be measured if someone digged down to the sea level. This is called sea-level pressure reduction, and since no air exists below ground, it is purely hypothetical, so that many assumptions needs to be made. For example, how temperature and humidity would vary going down cannot be properly defined.\n\nThe sea-level pressure reduction is carried out by means of the \n\nhypsometric equation:p_{MSL} = p_{obs}\\cdot \\exp\\bigg[\\frac{m_mgh}{R\\overline{T}}\\bigg]\n\nwhere h is the altitude in which the pressure p_{obs} is measured, p_{MSL} is the pressure at the MSL, and \\overline{T} is the mean temperature of the (moist) air with molar mass m_m (I omitted to explain the \n\nvirtual temperature, but the formula is equivalent). The hypsometric equation is basically the barometric formula (equation \n\n(7)), but with an average temperature across the vertical distance. The average temperature can simply be computed using the standard lapse rate Γ, and a 12-hour average surface temperature, an attempt to exclude the effect of the irradiation of surface of the Earth:\\overline{T} \\approx \\dfrac{T_{obs}(t) + T_{obs}(t-12h)}{2} - \\Gamma \\cdot \\dfrac{h}{2}\n\nAdditional refinements can be employed, but they are often empirical and specific to the station site. Mind that this pressure reduction is fictitious, and it is better to be consistent (across the world) rather than accurate. And I don’t like this.","type":"content","url":"/pressure-theoretical-model#humidity","position":19},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"The atmospheric pressure","lvl3":"Earth as a spinning spheroid","lvl2":"Theoretical model"},"type":"lvl3","url":"/pressure-theoretical-model#earth-as-a-spinning-spheroid","position":20},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"The atmospheric pressure","lvl3":"Earth as a spinning spheroid","lvl2":"Theoretical model"},"content":"Let’s now further improve our model by considering Earth as a spheroid (or ellipsoid) that spins and generates a gravitational field.

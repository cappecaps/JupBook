Welcome to this thing. I’m not sure what this is, but I created it with the intent of collecting all my “side projects” and publishing them in a single place. Driven by pure curiosity, I love to create mathematical models to describe phenomena, explore ideas, or solve doubts that pop up in my head. Nothing of what I’ve done is new, quite the opposite: I am obsessed with not looking anywhere for hints or solutions, except when strictly necessary, or I’m stuck for days on a single thing. It won’t be surprising that most of the things you will read here are likely well-known and derived with a bad inefficience. Many interpretations will be at the very least inaccurate. But this blog is not meant to be an enciclopedia, but rather a collection of my thoughts, ideas, and obsessions.","position":{"start":{"line":5,"column":1},"end":{"line":5,"column":1}},"key":"R7yhFDpM6n"}],"key":"D8AqF0Zal8"},{"type":"paragraph","position":{"start":{"line":7,"column":1},"end":{"line":7,"column":1}},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"I’ll be more than happy to receive any feedback, suggestions, or corrections!","position":{"start":{"line":7,"column":1},"end":{"line":7,"column":1}},"key":"DiXkazfA7W"}],"key":"VP7uun2cYd"},{"type":"paragraph","position":{"start":{"line":9,"column":1},"end":{"line":9,"column":1}},"children":[{"type":"strong","position":{"start":{"line":9,"column":1},"end":{"line":9,"column":1}},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Marco","position":{"start":{"line":9,"column":1},"end":{"line":9,"column":1}},"key":"Covg8o0zS9"}],"key":"HqrK1mQ92h"}],"key":"Q7f16zLuZ0"}],"key":"Z4BJExklCz"}],"key":"jICkgDeP3Y"},"references":{"cite":{"order":[],"data":{}}}}

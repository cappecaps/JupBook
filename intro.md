# The Hot Water Blog
 
> ...and to be really sure you need to have a doubt

Hello! Welcome to this thing. I'm not sure what this is, but I created it with the intent of collecting all my "side projects" and publishing them in a single place. Driven by pure curiosity, I love to create mathematical models to describe phenomena, explore ideas, or solve doubts that pop up in my head. Nothing of what I've done is new, quite the opposite: I am obsessed with not looking anywhere for hints or solutions, except when strictly necessary, or I'm stuck for days on a single thing. It won't be surprising that most of the things you will read here are likely well-known and derived with a bad inefficience. Many interpretations will be at the very least inaccurate. But this blog is not meant to be an enciclopedia, but rather a collection of my thoughts, ideas, and obsessions.

I'll be more than happy to receive any feedback, suggestions, or corrections!

> ...and to be really sure you need to have a doubt

Hello! Welcome to this thing. I'm not sure what this is, but I created it with the intent to collect all my "side projects", publish them in a single place, and making them available in the internet. 

Driven by a implacable curiosity, I am obsessed with creating mathematical models to describe the world around me, explore ideas, or solve doubts that pop up in my head. The model must be rigorously _ab initio_, namely from first principles. My end goal is, whether possible, to obtain analytical solutions. Modelling is a challenge that necessitates perseverance, but at the same time it stimulates deep thinking and sharpen your problem solving skills. Carefully choosing the approximations is in itself a real form of art: it requires creativity and imagination, as well as the skill to visualize your system and what you want to narrate through the model.

Nothing of what I've done is new, quite the opposite: I am obsessed with withdrawing in my shell and not looking anywhere for hints or solutions, except when strictly necessary. It won't be surprising that most of the things you will read here are surely already well-known, and many interpretations inaccurate at best. This blog is not meant to be an enciclopedia, rather a collection of my thoughts, ideas, and obsessions. If I ever catch the interest of even one person in the world, I'll be more than happy.

Please feel free to contact me for any feedback, suggestions, or corrections!
